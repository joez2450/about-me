### Short Biography
My name is Joe, and I was born in Manhattan, New York in July of 2008. When I was just one year old, I moved to China with my family. I was raised in my Grandparent's village for four years, and I came back to NYC upon my fourth birthday in 2012, to start my school career. Now, I am currently a sophomore student at the High School Of Telecommunication Arts and Technology, where I am enrolled in the SEP program.
